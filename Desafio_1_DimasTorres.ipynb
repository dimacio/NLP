My voice is coming to\n","you this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\n","station in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\n","meet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\n","health care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\n","broadcast with the American people. \n","             \n","             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\n","it reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\n","seven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\n","the people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\n","tour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\n","year's campaign.\n","             \n","             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\n","you, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\n","what I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\n","to you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n","             \n","             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\n","economy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\n","experiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\n","it is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\n","business.  \n","             \n","             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\n","rise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\n","of their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\n","cooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\n","labor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\n","industrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\n","made many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\n","our government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\n","have been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\n","falling behind.\n","             \n","             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\n","not producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\n","by four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\n","show for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\n","stopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\n","and that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\n","cost of health care.\n","             \n","             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\n","right incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\n","businesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\n","needs to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\n","places to live.\n","             \n","             In many critical products today Americans are the\n","low cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\n","we create more of those kinds of jobs.\n","             \n","             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\n","long-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\n","priorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\n","be -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\n","and education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\n","waste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\n","resources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\n","groundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n","             \n","             These new directions passed the Congress in record\n","time and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\n","country.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\n","create hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\n","sector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\n","now has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \n","But it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\n","Senate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\n","would result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n","             \n","             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \n","Millions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\n","counting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\n","has been grounded by gridlock.  \n","             \n","             I know the American people are tired of business as\n","usual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\n","or wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\n","taken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\n","mile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\n","percent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n","             \n","             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\n","Americans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\n","languish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\n","hundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\n","act to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\n","this initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\n","think we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\n","portion of our original goals.\n","             \n","             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\n","possible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\n","including highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\n","people, immunization for children, construction of waste water\n","sites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\n","for extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\n","have been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\n","creating jobs.\n","             \n","             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\n","in the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\n","percent.\n","             \n","             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\n","program to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\n","crime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\n","police officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\n","them back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\n","for a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\n","and deserve it.\n","             \n","             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\n","the Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\n","increases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\n","year that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\n","doesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\n","than paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\n","budget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\n","Congress this year.\n","             \n","             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\n","who are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\n","administration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\n","emergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\n","American people to work.  \n","             \n","             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\n","a plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\n","are -- on people or on politics.  \n","             \n","             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\n","for dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\n","soundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\n","children.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\n","and investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\n","us when we've helped make more American partners working to\n","ensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n","             \n","             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\n","one, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\n","country today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\n","step to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\n","again.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\n","for over the life of our budget.\n","             \n","             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\n","important the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n","             \n","             Good morning, and thank you for listening.\n"]}],"source":["# Veamos similaridad de documentos.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\n","the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\n","the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\n","strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\n","about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\n","the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\n","authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\n","least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\n","happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\n","will take particular claims at face value.\n","\n","Immanuel:\n","\n","       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n","\n","       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n","       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\n","       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n","       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n","       spoken by a prophet:\n","\n","       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n","       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n","       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n","       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n","       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n","       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n","       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \n","       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n","       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n","       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\n","       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n","       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\n","       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n","       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n","       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n","       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n","       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\n","       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n","       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n","       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n","       you dread will have been deserted...\n","\n","Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \n","Further, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\n","specifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\n","Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\n","later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\n","short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\n","context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\n","should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\n","manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\n","virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\n","the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\n","later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\n","the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\n","for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\n","class prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n","\n","Egypt:\n","\n","       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\n","quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\n","wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\n","alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n","\n","       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n","       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n","       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\n","\n","\n","What the lord really said was this.\n","\n","       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n","       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n","       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n","       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n","       incense to idols.\n","\n","Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\n","was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\n","return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\n","here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\n","up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\n","is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n","\n","Rachel Weeps:\n","\n","        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\n","King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\n","all young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n","\n","       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n","       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n","\n","       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n","       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n","       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n","       no more.\"   \n","\n","The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\n","carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\n","BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\n","and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\n","more.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\n","before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n","       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\n","was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\n","Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\n","it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\n","that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n","\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\n","       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\n","that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\n","event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\n","nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \n","Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\n","evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\n","prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\n","the message of the church's gospel.\n","       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\n","infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\n","up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\n","It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\n","the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\n","speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\n","comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\n","returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\n","would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\n","dead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\n","that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\n","convincing.\n","\n","The Nazarene:\n","\n","       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\n","another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\n","take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n","\n","       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n","       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n","\n","First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\n","the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \n","There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\n","there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\n","worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\n","all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\n","she will,\n","\n","       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n","       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n","       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n","       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\n","\n","This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \n","But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\n","begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\n","simple making them up now.\n","\n","Bearing our\n","Diseases:\n","\n","       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\n","and disabilities.\n","\n","       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n","       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\n","       diseases.\"\n","\n","As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\n","and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n","\n","       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n","       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n","\n","From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\n","the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\n","of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\n","Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\n","that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\n","identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\n","instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n","      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\n","are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\n","discipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\n","healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\n","sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\n","as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\n","verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\n","rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\n","that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\n","the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\n","that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\n","spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\n","misses where he intended it to have its effect.\n","\n","\n","Silent Messiah:\n","\n","      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\n","ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\n","the attention of the local rulers.\n","\n","       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n","       the prophet Isaiah.   \n","\n","       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n","       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n","       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n","       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n","       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n","       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n","       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n","       name.\"\n","\n","The Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n","\n","       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n","       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n","       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n","       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n","       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n","       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n","       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n","       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n","       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n","       await his law.\n","\n","You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\n","because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\n","never think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\n","burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\n","an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\n","G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\n","be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\n","from the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\n","Christologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\n","original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\n","to fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\n","has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\n","to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\n","but blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\n","plundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n","\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\n","\n","Three Days and\n","Three Nights:\n","\n","      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\n","mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\n","resurrection.\n","\n","       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n","       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n","       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n","       three nights.\n","\n","Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\n","how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n","24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n","6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\n","6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\n","scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n","6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\n","sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n","(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\n","Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\n","when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\n","portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\n","Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\n","unresurrected for three days and three nights.\n","\n","      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\n","hour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\n","grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\n","before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\n","over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\n","clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n","6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\n","Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\n","using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\n","nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\n","is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\n","are even able to have his death involve three days and three\n","nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\n","suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\n","mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\n","god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\n","than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n","\n","Hearing &\n","Understanding:\n","\n","     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\n","parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\n","you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\n","message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\n","parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\n","them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\n","accept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\n","\n","       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n","       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n","\n","       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n","       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n","       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n","       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n","       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n","       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n","       them.\"\n","\n","The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\n","call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\n","flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \n","Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\n","calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n","\n","       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\n","       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n","       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n","       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n","       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n","       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n","       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\n","       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\n","       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n","       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n","       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n","       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n","       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n","       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\n","       stump.\n","\n","Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\n","to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\n","promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\n","the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\n","of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\n","at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n","     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\n","of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\n","he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\n","understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\n","not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\n","present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n","\n","     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\n","have the prophetic approval.\n","\n","       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n","       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n","       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n","       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n","       foundation of the world.\"\n","\n","Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\n","prophet, but from the Psalms.\n","\n","       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n","       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n","       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n","       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n","       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n","       lord...\n","\n","As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\n","from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\n","of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \n","Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\n","of it up.\n","     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\n","again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\n","has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\n","understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \n","Further, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\n","us.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\n","world.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \n","This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\n","wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\n","Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\n","Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\n","only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n","\n","\n","Excuses of\n","Little Faith:\n","\n","       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\n","around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\n","epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\n","possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\n","unable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\n","enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\n","they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\n","demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\n","he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\n","mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\n","move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\n","Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\n","Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\n","woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n","\n","       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\n","ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\n","sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\n","heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\n","their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n","\n","     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\n","or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\n","old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\n","theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\n","God anymore.\n","\n","       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n","       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\n","       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n","       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n","\n","     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\n","reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\n","true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\n","heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\n","make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\n","our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\n","say, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\n","lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\n","lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\n","sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\n","not seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n","      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\n","human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\n","forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\n","by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\n","what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\n","has little faith.\n","\f\n","Jesus Rides on\n","an Ass:\n","\n","       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\n","king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\n","Jerusalem.  \n","\n","       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n","       by the prophet, saying,\n","\n","       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\n","       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n","       ass-colt.\"\n","\n","Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\n","differently.\n","\n","       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n","       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n","       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n","\n","There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\n","only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\n","poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\n","both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\n","comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\n","donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\n","proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\n","earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\n","Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\n","shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\n","bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\n","have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\n","the situation is often reversed nowadays...\n","\n","       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\n","angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\n","Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n","\n","       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n","       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n","\n","It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\n","was never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\n","since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\n","fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\n","Matthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\n","\n","       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n","       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n","       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n","       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n","       enemy and the avenger.\n","\n","The passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\n","spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\n","not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\n","just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\n","scripture.\n","\n","YHVH said to \n","my lord...:\n","\n","      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\n","messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\n","David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n","\n","       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n","       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\n","\n","Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\n","descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\n","course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\n","make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\n","nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\n","is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \n","But, there are problems.\n","       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\n","messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\n","messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\n","about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\n","bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\n","rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\n","passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\n","Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\n","psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\n","also made.  One must remember that there were various factions\n","among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\n","messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\n","his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\n","who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\n","What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n","\n","       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n","\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n","       footstool.\"\n","\n","       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n","       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n","       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n","       holy mountains.  \n","\n","       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n","       forever.\"\n","\n","The word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\n","bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\n","word is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n","\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\n","the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\n","address of respect.  \n","      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\n","refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\n","supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\n","psalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\n","David.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\n","poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\n","psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\n","talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\n","from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\n","tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\n","praises of a messiah.\n","     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\n","David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\n","favour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n","     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\n","promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\n","successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\n","the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\n","enabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n","      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\n","though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\n","his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\n","event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\n","a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\n","though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\n","Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \n","Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\n","an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\n","might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\n","embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n","\n","Moses & Jesus,\n","Had it Together\n","All Along...:\n","\n","       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\n","pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\n","deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\n","from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \n","But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\n","church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\n","king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\n","by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\n","a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\n","was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\n","Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the\n","fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\n","promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n","\n","       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n","       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n","\n","It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\n","Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \n","I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\n","which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\n","course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\n","his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\n","many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\n","still cling to it.\n","\n","The Potter's\n","Field:\n","\n","      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\n","one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n","\n","       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n","       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n","       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\n","       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n","       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n","       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n","       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n","\n","       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n","       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n","       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n","       field, as the lord directed me.\"\n","\n","This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\n","Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\n","of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\n","Matthew makes use of.\n","\n","       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n","       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\n","       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\n","       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n","       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n","       YHVH.\n","\n","First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\n","of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\n","a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\n","shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\n","one another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\n","James Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\n","Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\n","correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\n","makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\n","field\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\n","intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\n","Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\n","intentional dishonesty.\n","      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\n","text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\n","as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\n","the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\n","toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\n","directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\n","priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\n","treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\n","opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\n","the \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\n","Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\n","enough.\n","\n","Wine, Vinegar,\n","& Casting Lots:\n","\n","      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n","\n","       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n","       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n","       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n","       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n","       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n","\n","       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n","       vesture did they cast lots.\"\n","\n","First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\n","wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\n","that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\n","some to drink --not polluted with gall.\n","\n","       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\n","       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n","       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n","       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\n","\n","But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\n","prophets, but one from the Psalms.\n","\n","       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n","       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n","       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n","       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n","       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n","       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n","       Book of the Living.\n","\n","Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\n","of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\n","quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\n","is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\n","we run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\n","psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\n","Jesus of the gospels says,\n","\n","       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\n","       don't know what they do!\"\n","\n","Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\n","having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\n","meat, as the psalm stipulates.\n","\n","       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\n","ask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\n","Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\n","say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\n","great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\n","in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\n","erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\n","indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\n","Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\n","his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\n","suspicions.\n","\n","The 22nd Psalm:\n","\n","      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\n","condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\n","praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\n","seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\n","will examine the primary passages.\n","\n","       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n","       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n","       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n","       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n","\n","Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \n","This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\n","than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\n","fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\n","complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\n","lamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\n","groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\n","both day and night on the cross.\n","\n","       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n","       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n","       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n","       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\n","\n","This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\n","exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n","\n","       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n","       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n","\n","       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n","       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n","       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n","       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n","\n","       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n","       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n","       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n","       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n","\n","It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\n","fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\n","this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\n","do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n","\n","       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n","       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n","       hands and feet...\n","\n","In Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\n","which can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\n","word in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\n","which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\n","imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\n","would urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\n","add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\n","just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\n","correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\n","Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\n","translators.\n","\n","       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\n","itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\n","saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\n","psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\n","that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\n","the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\n","thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\n","his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n","\n","      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\n","attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\n","Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\n","the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\n","interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\n","scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\n","is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\n","theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\n","fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\n","have been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\n","it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\n","matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\n","things for St. Matthew.\n","\n","The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\n","crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\n","the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n","\n","       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n","       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n","       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n","       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\n","\n","Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\n","context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\n","Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\n","them.\n","\n","       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n","       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n","       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n","       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n","       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n","       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n","       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n","\n","John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\n","Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\n","than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\n","blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\n","writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\n","religion were founded.\n","\n","\f\n","Reckoned with\n","Transgressors:\n","\n","       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\n","the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\n","the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n","\n","       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n","       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n","       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n","\n","       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\n","\n","Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\n","about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\n","messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\n","surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\n","verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\n","past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\n","servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\n","description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\n","messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\n","two thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\n","more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\n","considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\n","career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\n","steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\n","have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n","\n","       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\n","[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\n","couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\n","decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n","\n","       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n","       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n","       yourself, and us!\"\n","\n","This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\n","people who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\n","robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n","\n","       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n","       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n","       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n","       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n","       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n","       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \n","       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\n","       will be with me in paradise.\"\n","\n","Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\n","the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\n","his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\n","strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\n","punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\n","apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\n","been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\n","Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \n","Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\n","enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\n","up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\n","words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\n","example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\n","expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\n","the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\n","seen.\n","\n","The End of the\n","World--\n","       Mt. 24:\n","\n","       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\n","embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\n","three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\n","unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\n","mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\n","his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\n","which he has been warning about.\n","\n","       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n","       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n","       coming, and of the close of the age?\n","\n","       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n","       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \n","       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n","       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n","       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n","       beginning of the birthpangs.\n","             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n","       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n","       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n","       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n","       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n","             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n","       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n","       the mountains.\n","\n","             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n","       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n","       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n","       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n","       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n","       his angels... and gather his elect...\n","             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n","       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n","       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n","       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n","       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n","       pass away until all these things take place...\n","             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n","       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n","       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n","       at an hour you do not expect.\n","\n","From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\n","within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\n","them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\n","will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\n","their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \n","But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\n","disciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\n","and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\n","swept away.\n","      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\n","nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\n","shall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\n","pass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\n","times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \n","It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\n","he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\n","quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\n","least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \n","The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\n","at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\n","Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\n","meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n","\n","       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\n","chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\n","years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\n","hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \n","Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\n","tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\n","just the right moment to spring?\n","\n","\n","       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n","(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\n","three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\n","eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\n","less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\n","radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\n","interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\n","disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \n","As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\n","people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\n","Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\n","seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\n","Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\n","belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\n","argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\n","from question.  To question and investigate has never been the\n","easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\n","prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\n","accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \n","Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\n","have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\n","wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\n","Christianity can securely keep hold.\n","-------------- Indice del 6880 documento mas cercano: 6880 --------------\n","\n","Documento similar: categoría talk.politics.misc\n","SECRET PURPOSE OF FALKLANDS WAR;  [with IN-VISIBILITY Technology]\n","\n","Dr. Beter AUDIO LETTER #74 of 80\n","\n","Digitized by Jon Volkoff, mail address eidetics@cerf.net\n","\n","\"AUDIO LETTER(R)\" is a registered trademark of Audio Books,\n","Inc., a Texas corporation, which originally produced this tape\n","recording.

Today is April 30,\n","1982, and this is my AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 74.\n","\n","  It's now been almost one month since war broke out in the South\n","Atlantic.  On the surface it seems that it's only a dispute\n","between Argentina and Great Britain over the barren, wind-swept\n","Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island.  In reality, it's far\n","more than that.\n","\n","   The so-called Falklands crisis is just the visible tip of a\n","giant military operation.  During this month of April 1982,\n","fierce naval battles have taken place--not only in the South\n","Atlantic but also in the South Pacific.  Up to now most of the\n","hostilities have been kept under wraps by wartime censorship on\n","all sides.  But as I say these words, the naval war in the\n","Southern Hemisphere is about to come to the surface.\n","\n","   Beginning today, April 30, a total naval and air blockade of\n","the Falklands by the Royal Navy has begun.  At the same time a\n","counterblockade has been declared by Argentina in the same area.\n","\n","   To be effective, a blockade must be imposed over a period of\n","time, but the Royal Navy does not have that much time.  Winter is\n","coming on in the South Atlantic, and the British supply lines are\n","overextended.  Having come this far, Her Majesty's navy cannot\n","simply drop the blockade and sail away in a few weeks time\n","without drawing blood from Argentina.  As a result the British\n","will be forced to undertake military operations very soon no\n","matter how risky they may be.\n","\n","   There is also another reason why the Royal Navy now has no\n","choice but to engage the Argentine forces in combat.  That\n","reason, my friends, is that the Royal Navy has already suffered\n","losses in secret combat this month.  Up to this moment there will\n","be no way to explain away the damage which has been sustained by\n","the British fleet.  Only when publicly admitted fighting erupts\n","will the British dare to admit that they have suffered battle\n","losses.  To obtain that cover story, the British have no choice\n","but to sail into combat; but in doing so, they will be risking\n","even heavier losses on top of those already sustained.  In short,\n","my friends, Her Majesty's navy has sailed into a trap.\n","\n","   The events now unfolding in the South Atlantic carry strange,\n","ironic echoes of the past.  For weeks now we've been hearing\n","countless commentators referring to the British task force as an\n","\"armada\" (quote).  The British of all people ought to be very\n","uneasy with that description.  The original Spanish Armada 400\n","years ago was renowned as a seemingly invincible fighting force,\n","but it came to grief in a naval disaster so complete that it\n","changed the course of history--and it was none other than the\n","English navy that destroyed the Spanish Armada.\n","\n","   The original Spanish Armada put to sea in 1588 during the\n","reign of England's Queen Elizabeth I.  The Armada was an invasion\n","fleet carrying thousands of crack fighting men to invade England. \n","They were met by the daring sea dogs of Sir Francis Drake.  Drake\n","and his small, fast ships turned the tables on the Spanish Armada\n","by changing the rules of battle.  The English fleet was equipped\n","with new longer-range guns, and it stayed upwind and out of\n","reach.  From there the English pounded, smashed, and shattered\n","the big ships of the mighty Armada.  When it was all over, barely\n","half the Spanish fleet was left to limp back to port.  Drake's\n","defeat of the Spanish Armada was a shock to the world.  It opened\n","the door for England under Queen Elizabeth I to start its\n","expansion into a truly global empire.\n","\n","   Today, 400 years later, history seems to have come full\n","circle.  Queen Elizabeth II is witnessing the dismantling of the\n","world empire whose heyday began under Queen Elizabeth I, and now\n","the cultures of England and of Spain are once again in\n","confrontation.  Once again a so-called armada is preparing for\n","invasion, but this time the armada is British, not Spanish.  Four\n","hundred years ago Sir Francis Drake was the hero of the day;\n","today, the ghost of Francis Drake is once again on the scene.\n","\n","   The South Atlantic war zone is at the eastern end of the Drake\n","Passage around the southern tip of South America.  The defeat of\n","the Spanish Armada four centuries ago broke the back of Spain's\n","naval supremacy, and now the defeat of the new British armada may\n","well break the back of what remains of the once glorious Royal\n","Navy.\n","\n","   My three special topics for this AUDIO LETTER are:\n","\n","Topic #1--THE MILITARY SECRET OF SOUTH GEORGIA ISLAND\n","Topic #2--THE SECRET NAVAL WAR OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE\n","Topic #3--THE ROCKEFELLER FEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST NUCLEAR WAR.\n","\n","Topic #1--When the Falkland Islands crisis began early this month\n","it looked at first like a tempest in a teapot.  For a century and\n","a half since 1833, the Islands have been controlled by Great\n","Britain.  During that entire time, British sovereignty over the\n","Falklands has been disputed by Argentina.  There have been\n","countless threats by Argentina to seize the Islands, which it\n","calls the Malvinas, but the threats have always come to nothing\n","in the past and Britain has never even gotten very worried about\n","them.\n","\n","   The Islands are four times as distant from Argentina as Cuba\n","is from the United States, and they are not much of a prize. \n","After 150 years of occupancy, the Falklands are home to fewer\n","than 2,000 British settlers and a lot of sheep.  In short, the\n","remote Falkland Islands hardly look like something to fight over,\n","and yet here we are watching another crisis take place.  We are\n","watching as war erupts between Great Britain and Argentina.\n","\n","   The Thatcher government is acting as if it has forgotten all\n","about its usual preoccupation with the Soviet threat at NATO's\n","doorstep.  Instead, Britain is throwing almost everything it's\n","got at Argentina---aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers,\n","submarines, assault ships--you name it.  Luxury cruise ships have\n","even been commissioned and turned into troop carriers overnight. \n","Wave after wave of additional assault troops have been activated\n","and sent to join the fleet even after it sailed.  Ships and\n","submarines have been pulled off station from normal NATO duty and\n","sent to reinforce the task force.  The initial 40-ship force has\n","grown steadily over the past several weeks into an armada\n","numbering over 70.  Over two-thirds of the entire Royal Navy has\n","already been deployed to the South Atlantic off Argentina.\n","\n","   Watching all this, a lot of people are asking: What's this\n","fight really all about?  The most popular answer suggested in the\n","major media is \"oil.\"  Vast deposits of oil are known to exist\n","under the continental shelf between Argentina and the Falklands,\n","but that has been known for nearly 10 years.  In no way does it\n","explain the timing of the sudden military offensive by Argentina\n","this month, and oil explains even less about the Argentine\n","seizure of South Georgia Island.\n","\n","   South Georgia Island is 800 miles east of the Falklands with\n","no known oil deposits anywhere near it; and compared to South\n","Georgia, the Falklands are an island paradise.  South Georgia\n","Island is covered with rugged mountains, treacherous valleys,\n","glaciers, and semi-permanent snow.  Most of it is uninhabitable. \n","On top of all that, Argentina has absolutely no legal or\n","historical claim to South Georgia Island.  In that respect it\n","stands in sharp contrast to the Falklands.\n","\n","   In the early 1830s the Falklands were occupied for a while by\n","Argentine colonists.  In 1833 the British expelled them and took\n","over the Island.  For that and other historical reasons,\n","Argentina argues that the Falklands really belong to Argentina,\n","not Britain.\n","\n","   But no such argument is possible for South Georgia Island.  It\n","has always been controlled by Britain, never by Argentina or\n","Spain.  The Argentine seizure of South Georgia Island looks even\n","more unreasonable from a military point of view.  Argentina's\n","leaders are military men and they think in military terms.  They\n","were well aware ahead of time that far-off South Georgia Island\n","could not possibly be held for long.  By seizing it they were\n","setting themselves up to absorb a military defeat, as the Island\n","was retaken by Britain.  So the question is: Why did Argentina's\n","military junta bother with the seemingly worthless South Georgia\n","Island at all?\n","\n","   My friends, the answers to all these questions are military,\n","not political or economic.  South Georgia Island possesses an\n","enormous military secret.  It's a giant underground installation\n","buried under the mountains at the northwest end of the Island. \n","The real reason for the so-called Falkland crisis is this secret\n","installation, together with two other similar installations which\n","I will describe shortly.\n","\n","   The secret military complexes have been in existence for many\n","years; they are not new.  What is new is the accelerated nuclear\n","war timetable of the American Bolshevik war planners here in\n","Washington.  For the past two months I've been reporting the\n","details of this new war plan to you as quickly as I can obtain\n","and verify them.\n","\n","   The plan calls for NUCLEAR WAR ONE to erupt by September of\n","this year 1982!!  It is this fast-approaching nuclear war threat\n","that caused the so-called Falklands crisis to erupt now.\n","\n","   What is going on now is a coordinated effort to spoil part of\n","the Bolshevik grand strategy for the coming nuclear war.  The\n","mutual enemies of the American Bolsheviks here--namely, the\n","Rockefeller cartel--and Russia's new rulers in the Kremlin are\n","behind the present crisis.  They are trying to ruin Phase #3 of\n","the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan which I revealed last month.  That phase\n","is to be world domination by the American Bolsheviks after both\n","Russia and the United States have been destroyed in NUCLEAR WAR\n","ONE.  As I mentioned last month, the key to this plan is the\n","existence of secret weapons stockpiles in various places around\n","the world.\n","\n","   The American Bolshevik military planners here in America are\n","working with other Bolshevik agents in key military positions of\n","other countries to set off war.  Having done that, they intend to\n","ride out the nuclear holocaust they have caused, safe and cozy in\n","Government war bunkers!  When the warring nations finally lie\n","smoldering and exhausted, the Bolsheviks will leave the shattered\n","remains of their host countries.  They will rendezvous at the\n","secret weapons installations and bring their weapons into the\n","open.  They will confront the world with the only remaining\n","fresh, up-to-date, powerful military force on earth; and using\n","that military power, they will become the undisputed rulers of\n","the world--that is, they plan to do all this, and they plan to\n","pave the way for world domination very soon by setting off\n","NUCLEAR WAR ONE in a matter of months.  The Rockefeller cartel\n","and Russia's new anti-Bolshevik rulers are working together in a\n","race against time to try to head off the Bolshevik war plan.\n","\n","   Last month I mentioned that the Bolsheviks here are\n","benefitting from war preparations which were started by the\n","Rockefellers long ago.  It has only been about three years since\n","the Rockefellers were dislodged as the prime movers of the United\n","States Government by the Bolsheviks.  Since that time the United\n","States Government has been a house divided, torn by internal\n","power struggles between rival Bolshevik and Rockefeller factions. \n","But before that, the United States had been dominated for decades\n","both economically and politically by the Four Rockefeller\n","Brothers.\n","\n","   In 1961 the Brothers launched a new long-range plan for world\n","domination.  It was a two-prong strategy, half visible and half\n","secret, which I first described long ago in AUDIO LETTER No. 28. \n","It was a plan for the United States to arm to the teeth in secret\n","while appearing to disarm gradually.  Without repeating all the\n","details, the basic idea was grandiose yet simple.  By\n","deliberately appearing weak, the Rockefeller-controlled United\n","States would maneuver itself into a nuclear war with Russia. \n","Then the secret weapons, including superweapons, would be\n","unleashed to smash Russia and take over the world.\n","\n","   When they set the grand plan in motion in 1961, the\n","Rockefeller Brothers were looking ahead to a nuclear war by the\n","late 1970s.  Their military analysts concluded very early that\n","the war being planned would have very different effects on the\n","Northern and Southern Hemispheres.  Both superpowers, the United\n","States and the Soviet Union, are located well up in the Northern\n","Hemisphere; so are the other full-fledged nuclear powers--Great\n","Britain, France, Red China, and India.  By contrast, the\n","strategic targets for nuclear war in the Southern Hemisphere are\n","relatively few and far between.  In other words, it was expected\n","that the coming nuclear war would be essentially a Northern\n","Hemisphere war.\n","\n","   In an all-out nuclear holocaust it is known that serious\n","radioactive fallout will gradually spread to affect even areas\n","not initially hit by war.  But there are limits to how far the\n","war clouds can spread.  It was discovered long ago that there is\n","very little mixing between the air of the Northern and Southern\n","Hemispheres.  In the northern half of our planet, cold air from\n","the North Pole works its way southward towards the equator, then\n","it works its way back to the north as warm air.  A mirror image\n","of this process takes up the southern half of the planet. \n","Northern and Southern Hemisphere air meet in the equatorial zone,\n","but very little of the air changes places.\n","\n","   The military conclusion, my friends, is this: the coming\n","nuclear war could ruin large areas of the Northern Hemisphere for\n","generations to come; but if the calculations are right, the\n","Southern Hemisphere could escape virtually unaffected by the war. \n","This was music to the ears of the Four Rockefeller Brothers.  A\n","quick look at the globe of the world shows why.  The Rockefeller\n","cartel has dominated Latin America ever since World War II.  As I\n","discussed in my very first monthly AUDIO LETTER, Nelson\n","Rockefeller solidified the cartel grip on Latin America during\n","the war.  He accomplished this as so-called \"Coordinator of\n","Hemispheric Defense\" for then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. \n","So that takes care of the South American continent and its\n","natural resources.\n","\n","   Then there is the African continent.  There, too, Rockefeller\n","control was already in effect over wide areas of Black Africa,\n","especially south of the equator.  All this was thanks to the\n","efforts of John D. Rockefeller III, as I detailed in AUDIO LETTER\n","No. 36.\n","\n","   Looking around the globe, the most important remaining land\n","masses from the standpoint of world domination are Australia and\n","New Zealand.  Thanks to World War II, both were wide open to the\n","Rockefellers.\n","\n","   The Rockefeller Brothers decided to establish secret military\n","installations in the Southern Hemisphere for use after the coming\n","war.  By this means they expected to become the masters of the\n","surviving southern half of planet Earth after the Northern\n","Hemisphere war.  Then, as the Northern Hemisphere gradually\n","recovered from the nuclear holocaust, the Rockefeller empire\n","would be able to pick up the pieces.  In this way the third\n","generation Rockefeller Brothers expected their family dynasty to\n","inherit the Earth.\n","\n","   In order to control the Southern Hemisphere militarily after\n","the war, some means would have to be available to project\n","military power onto any land mass.  For example, revolts against\n","Rockefeller domination would require troops--not a blast from the\n","beam weapons on the Moon.  The most critical factor for postwar\n","military domination of the world was found to be a navy.  A\n","minimum of two secret naval fleets would be required--one based\n","in the South Atlantic, the other in the South Pacific.  Since the\n","reserve naval fleets were to be kept secret until after the\n","Northern Hemisphere nuclear war, they could not be built in\n","existing shipyards.  New construction facilities had to be built\n","and they had to be hidden.  To hide an entire shipyard is no\n","small task; they take up a lot of space.  On top of that, it was\n","essential that the ships remain hidden after they were built. \n","The best way to achieve that was to combine the shipyard and\n","naval base into one over-all secret installation.  Finally, the\n","secret naval installation had to be invulnerable to nuclear\n","attack; otherwise if its existence were ever discovered\n","prematurely, the secret navy might be wiped out.\n","\n","   The combined requirements for secrecy, space, and protection\n","against attack were formidable; but one day in 1959, while all\n","these plans were still in the early stages of development, the\n","answer presented itself.  During a so-called banking trip to\n","Sweden, David Rockefeller was given a tour of a unique hidden\n","naval port.  The port is hollowed out from solid granite cliffs\n","which come right down to the water.  The entrance to the port is\n","a gigantic hole in the side of the cliff which can be sealed off\n","with enormous steel doors.  Inside this big doorway on the water\n","a huge cavity has been hollowed out to accommodate ships.\n","\n","   The Rockefeller Brothers and their military adviser decided\n","that a bigger, more secret, better protected version of the\n","Swedish hidden port was just what they wanted.  A survey of\n","candidate sites was then initiated.  The site survey covered\n","coastal areas throughout the Southern Hemisphere.  Many areas\n","were rejected very quickly because the topography was wrong. \n","Other areas were rejected because they were too close to the\n","equator.  Still others had to be ruled out because there were too\n","many people living nearby, making the desired level of secrecy\n","impossible.  Finally, it was essential that the sites chosen for\n","the secret naval installations be totally secure politically.\n","\n","   At last the sites for the secret naval installations were\n","selected.  In the South Pacific, extreme southern New Zealand was\n","selected.  This is what I was alluding to in AUDIO LETTER No. 71\n","three months ago when I called attention to New Zealand's extreme\n","importance in the coming war.\n","\n","   In order to obtain the necessary space, the secret New Zealand\n","naval installation had to be divided up into two sites located\n","close together.  One is at the extreme southwest tip of South\n","Island where the mountain range known as the Southern Alps comes\n","down virtually to the water's edge.  The other part of the\n","installation is built into the northwest tip of Stewart Island,\n","which is off the tip of South Island.  The Stewart Island\n","facility is hollowed out within a rise known as Mt. Anglem.\n","\n","   The New Zealand location met all the requirements.  Ever since\n","World War II the government of New Zealand has been tied even\n","closer to the United States than to Great Britain.  The location\n","is far from the equator, and the installations are buried deep\n","under mountains, protected from nuclear attack.  They are also\n","too deep to be reached by particle-beam attacks, and the New\n","Zealand site is well situated to command the entire South\n","Pacific.\n","\n","   In the South Atlantic an even more perfect site was found. \n","That site, my friends, is South Georgia Island.  It is located\n","perfectly for naval domination of the entire South Atlantic.  The\n","tall, rugged mountains provided a perfect location for the secret\n","installation at the northwest tip of the 100-mile long island. \n","It is controlled by Great Britain whose government, like that of\n","New Zealand, was willing to cooperate; and South Georgia Island\n","was virtually uninhabited except for a whaling station on the\n","northeast coast.  The whaling station was some 50 miles away from\n","the secret new installation which was being built, but Britain\n","took no chances.  In 1965 the whaling station was closed down. \n","Since that time there have been no inhabitants on South Georgia\n","Island except for a few dozen alleged Antarctic scientists.\n","\n","   Construction of the secret naval facilities--two in New\n","Zealand, one on South Georgia Island--began in the early 1960's. \n","The techniques were adapted from those used previously to build\n","other large underground facilities, such as the NORAD\n","installation inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; however these\n","techniques were adapted in radically new ways to achieve\n","construction access directly from the sea instead of overland. \n","In this way, the sheltering mountain was left undisturbed in\n","appearance both during and after construction.\n","\n","   The cuts in the mountain side which were necessary to let\n","ships in and out were kept as small as possible and were well\n","camouflaged.  Like the Swedish hidden naval port arrangement, the\n","entrances to the secret installations can be sealed up.  When\n","sealed, the entrance is virtually impossible to detect unless you\n","know exactly where it is; and unlike most large construction\n","projects, there are no tailings or piles of leftover rock lying\n","around to attract attention.  The man-made caverns which house\n","the secret naval installations are enormous, but all the rock and\n","debris was disposed of at sea.\n","\n","   Once the secret naval facilities were built, they had to be\n","outfitted for ship construction and docksite storage.  The fake\n","disarmament of the United States during the 1960s contributed\n","greatly to this task.  From 1961 to 1968 one man played a pivotal\n","role in this elaborate Rockefeller scheme.  He was then-Secretary\n","of Defense Robert McNamara.  All through the 60's McNamara\n","presided over the public paring back of America's visible\n","military power.  This included the closing down and dismantling\n","of entire shipyards.  What we were not told was where all that\n","shipyard equipment went afterwards.  Where it went, my friends,\n","was to the new secret installations which were being outfitted in\n","New Zealand and South Georgia Island!\n","\n","   The secret naval installations have been used as duplication\n","facilities to reproduce certain ships and submarines designed and\n","built here in the United States.  As Defense Secretary Caspar\n","Weinberger told Congress recently, it is cheaper to build two\n","ships at a time.  That is especially true if the second ship is\n","an exact duplicate of the first.  This has become even more true\n","in recent years through the use of computerized manufacturing\n","techniques.\n","\n","   The secret naval fleets which have been built at the secret\n","installations are made up of duplicates--exact duplicates of\n","certain other ships and submarines.  They are all nuclear\n","powered--nuclear \"subs\"; nuclear cruisers; nuclear destroyers;\n","and yes, nuclear aircraft carriers, three of them.  A secret twin\n","was built for the U.S.S. Nimitz, for the U.S.S. Eisenhower, and\n","for the newly-launched U.S.S. Carl Vincent.  All have been\n","financed through the gigantic cost overruns, so called, that we\n","constantly hear about in the Defense Department; and all three\n","carriers have been provided with a full complement of aircraft\n","whose manufacture was financed the same way!\n","\n","   The ships of the secret American Bolshevik naval fleets are\n","all duplicates of other nuclear-powered vessels.  Even so, the\n","secret naval ships possess one key difference.\n","\n","   Last month I revealed that the so-called \"Stealth Program\" has\n","succeeded in developing a kind of electromagnetic invisibility\n","shield.  This technique makes an object invisible from a distance\n","by distorting light waves in its vicinity.\n","\n","   A whole new fleet of Phantom war-planes are now going into\n","crash production that use this principle; and, my friends, all of\n","the secret American Bolshevik navy ships have already been\n","outfitted with similar Stealth-field equipment!  The Stealth\n","principle is actually easier to apply to ships than to airplanes\n","because there is more room for the powerful equipment that\n","generates the field.\n","\n","   After NUCLEAR WAR ONE, the secret Stealth navy of the American\n","Bolsheviks would be light years ahead of any other navy left on\n","earth.  It would be perfect for the intended role of world\n","domination.  The Rockefellers set it all in motion long ago, my\n","friends, but three years ago they lost control of the United\n","States Military.  Now it's the American Bolsheviks who are in\n","control, and they are bent on war.\n","\n","   These secret naval installations have precipitated what is\n","being called the \"Falklands crisis.\"\n","\n","Topic #2--In AUDIO LETTER(R) No. 73 last month I described\n","\"PROJECT Z\", the new Bolshevik three-phase strategy for NUCLEAR\n","WAR ONE.\n","\n","   An elite group of American Bolshevik military planners here\n","are flushing out the plan right now at a secret war-room here in\n","Washington.  It's a plan by which the United States will strike\n","the first nuclear blow, followed by all-out thermonuclear war\n","with Russia.\n","\n","   Having set off the holocaust, the Bolsheviks here and in\n","certain other countries plan to rise it out safe in comfortable\n","war bunkers.  Finally after NUCLEAR WAR ONE fizzles out in\n","stalemate, they plan to leave behind the ashes of the United\n","States and her allies.  Activating Phase #3 of their grand\n","strategy, they plan to unveil their secret weapons, especially\n","their secret naval fleets.  With these they plan to conquer and\n","rule what is left of the world.  The United States as we know it\n","will be dead and gone; but in the eyes of the Bolsheviks\n","themselves, this outcome will constitute victory.\n","\n","   Up to now the nuclear war timetable which I first revealed two\n","months ago is still on track.  They are still shooting for\n","nuclear war to begin by September of this year 1982!  Time is\n","fast running out.\n","\n","   The Bolsheviks here are sprinting as fast as they can toward\n","war; but, my friends, the Bolsheviks are not the only runners in\n","this race.  They have two deadly enemies, both of whom are\n","equally determined to trip up the Bolsheviks.  One enemy of the\n","Bolsheviks here is the Rockefeller cartel; the other enemy is the\n","new anti-Bolshevik ruling clique in Russia; and now these two\n","mutual enemies of the Bolsheviks are pooling their efforts in\n","certain ways.\n","\n","   In AUDIO LETTER No. 71 three months ago I reported that a\n","limited, new anti-Bolshevik coalition was in the works between\n","the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians.  The January 26 meeting\n","between Haig and Gromyko in Geneva, Switzerland, was a turning\n","point in the formation of this coalition.  It is now a reality,\n","and is responsible for the so-called \"Falkland crisis\" now\n","dominating the headlines.  It should be emphasized that this new\n","relationship between the Rockefeller cartel and Russia falls far\n","short of a true alliance.  They have very major disputes to be\n","settled between them, but for the time being they have called a\n","truce between themselves to deal with their mutual deadly\n","enemy--the Bolsheviks here in America.\n","\n","   The first priority of the Russians and the Rockefellers is to\n","slow down the Bolshevik preparations for imminent nuclear war. \n","If they can do that, time is on the side of the Rockefeller\n","cartel in certain political movements which I discussed last\n","summer in AUDIO LETTER No. 67.  A slow-down in the nuclear war\n","timetable will also give more breathing space for additional\n","anti-Bolshevik actions to be implemented.\n","\n","   The joint Rockefeller-Russian planners decided by mid-February\n","that military action against the Bolsheviks was essential very\n","quickly.  No other type of action had any hope of taking effect\n","fast enough to prevent nuclear war by the end of this summer.\n","\n","   The exact details of the \"PROJECT Z\" war plan are not known to\n","either the Rockefellers or the Russians, but the general outlines\n","are known to be as I described last month.\n","\n","   It was decided that military action should be devised that\n","would undermine Phase #3 of the Bolshevik war plan--that is, the\n","Bolshevik-controlled secret naval installations and fleets in the\n","Southern Hemisphere should be attacked and crippled.  By working\n","together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians were able to\n","devise an attack plan which neither could have carried out alone. \n","The Rockefeller group, who built and originally controlled these\n","bases, provided detailed Intelligence about the best way to\n","attack them.  The Russians with their enormous military machine\n","provided the muscle to actually carry out the attack.\n","\n","   It was essential to devise a scheme that would enable both\n","secret fleets in the South Atlantic and South Pacific to be\n","attacked.  Survival intact of either fleet would leave the\n","Bolshevik war plan still workable.\n","\n","   Military analysts concluded very quickly that a direct assault\n","on the New Zealand facilities was out of the question.  There was\n","no combination of commandos, frogmen, or other military force\n","which could possibly keep an attack secret from the outside\n","world.  Any attack on the New Zealand bases would set off the\n","very war which the Rockefellers and Russians want to prevent.\n","\n","   But the situation in the South Atlantic was a different\n","matter.  In a way, the greatest asset of South Georgia Island was\n","also its Achilles' heel.  The extreme isolation which protected\n","the secrecy of the South Georgia base also made a covert military\n","assault feasible.  The key lay with Argentina and her\n","long-standing claims to the Falkland Islands.\n","\n","   As I mentioned in Topic #1, the Rockefeller cartel has\n","dominated all of Latin America for decades.  Cartel operatives\n","were sent to Argentina to work out a deal with the government\n","military junta there.  The historic dispute over the Falkland\n","Islands was to be used to provide a ruse, a military cover, to\n","enable the South Georgia base to be attacked.  The Argentine\n","generals were not told everything about the situation by any\n","means, but they were told enough to make clear what they were to\n","do.\n","\n","   As an inducement to cooperate, the Argentine leaders were\n","promised handsome rewards.  They were guaranteed that after the\n","shooting was over, the Falkland Islands would remain in Argentine\n","hands.  This guarantee included the promise of covert military\n","assistance as needed against the Royal Navy.  And to bolster the\n","troubled Argentine economy, it was promised that the Rockefeller\n","cartel will help develop the immense offshore oil reserves.  With\n","these combined promises of military glory and financial rewards,\n","the Argentine military junta agreed to the plan.\n","\n","   On March 19 Argentina carried out Act #1 in the joint attack\n","plan.  A group of Argentine scrap-metal merchants, of all things,\n","landed at the abandoned old whaling station on South Georgia\n","Island.  Supposedly they were there to dismantle the old\n","buildings and cart them off to sell.  While they were at it they\n","also raised the Argentine flag over the work-site.  The British,\n","always nervous about South Georgia Island, promptly reacted as\n","expected.  The British Antarctic survey ship \"Endurance\" put 22\n","Marines ashore.  They drove off the scrap merchants and tore down\n","the Argentine flag.\n","\n","   The incident provided the desired excuse for the Argentine\n","Junta to bring the simmering 150-year-old Falklands dispute to a\n","boil.  From time to time in the past, Argentina has claimed that\n","South Georgia is part of the Falklands because it is administered\n","that way by Britain.  That argument is very flimsy but it now\n","came in very handy.  It was nothing new to hear this from\n","Argentine leaders, so there was no hint of what was really afoot.\n","\n","   During late March, Argentine military forces started\n","assembling for an assault on the Falklands.  \"Nothing new\",\n","thought the British high command.  Argentina has carried out\n","threatening maneuvers in the past many times.  It was believed\n","that they were about to do it again; but on April 2 Argentine\n","forces did the unexpected.  After many past false alarms, this\n","time they actually invaded and seized the Islands.  All Argentine\n","public statements emphasized the long-standing historical claims\n","to the Falklands themselves; but just for good measure, the next\n","day a small Argentine force also seized far-off South Georgia\n","Island.  The force was so small that it gave the appearance\n","initially that it was just a side show from Argentina's point of\n","view; however, the small contingent of 22 Royal Marines were\n","overpowered and bundled off the Island along with a group of 13\n","alleged scientists.  That was the moment of payoff in the joint\n","Rockefeller-Russian attack plan.\n","\n","   Thanks to the elaborate distraction staged by the Argentine\n","forces, a special commando team got onto the Island undetected. \n","Based on the detailed Rockefeller information about the base, the\n","team moved to a location on the mountain directly above the\n","cavernous secret base.  Special high-speed drilling equipment was\n","set up by the Rockefeller members of the team while the Russian\n","members concentrated on military defense.  By late that evening,\n","April 3, the military high command in London finally learned what\n","was really taking place.  The secret South Georgia base was under\n","attack by virtually the only means possible.  The joint\n","Rockefeller-Russian team were drilling a shaft down through the\n","mountain toward the hollowed out cavern inside.  It was only a\n","matter of time until their drill would break through the ceiling\n","of the giant hidden naval base.  Once the hole was made, the next\n","step was obvious.  The Rockefeller-Russian team would put a\n","weapon of some kind through the hole.  The best guess was that it\n","would be a nerve gas.\n","\n","   The shock waves that went through the highest levels of the\n","British government on the evening of April 3 can hardly be\n","described, my friends.  The Thatcher government, like the\n","so-called Reagan Administration here in America, is Bolshevik\n","controlled.  That's why Margaret Thatcher always says, \"Me, too\"\n","any time the Reagan Administration says or does anything against\n","Russia.  Both governments are party to the secret nuclear war\n","plan in complete betrayal of the people of their respective\n","countries, and on the evening of April 3 they suddenly discovered\n","that their precious war plan was in deep, deep trouble.\n","\n","   Immediately the Thatcher government started assembling a naval\n","armada to sail for the South Atlantic.  Haste was the order of\n","the day.  The drilling on South Georgia Island was proceeding\n","around the clock.  The best estimates were that the drilling\n","would break through into the roof of the naval base in about\n","three weeks, on or about April 24.  If help did not reach South\n","Georgia by then, the secret installation might be doomed.  The\n","forces stationed at the installation itself were unable to defend\n","themselves under the circumstances.  Their mighty naval ships\n","were ships in a bottle.  They did not dare open the bottle to\n","sail out to fight because the Russian commandos were armed with\n","tactical and nuclear weapons.  To open the blast-proof entrance\n","doors would be suicide.\n","\n","   On April 5, just two days after South Georgia Island was\n","seized, some 40 naval ships began moving out of British ports. \n","The same day Lord Carrington was sacked as Foreign Minister.  He\n","was forced to resign, my friends, because he had assisted the\n","Rockefeller attack plan by downplaying the Argentine attack\n","preparations.\n","\n","   That same day, April 5, New Zealand, the home of the other\n","secret naval fleet, broke diplomatic relations with Argentina. \n","The two hidden New Zealand facilities had been placed on \"Red\n","Alert.\"  As a precautionary measure, all submarines at the twin\n","base were ordered to sea.  Several surface ships were already at\n","sea undergoing \"sea trials\", but that still left seven (7) major\n","ships inside the hidden twin naval base including one of the\n","nuclear aircraft carriers I mentioned earlier.\n","\n","   On that busy day of April 5, Argentina's Foreign Minister,\n","Costa Mendez, was at the United Nations in New York.  He was\n","alarmed by the deployment of such a large part of the Royal Navy. \n","Costa Mendez hurried here to Washington to seek reassurances from\n","certain officials.  He got them!\n","\n","   For the next two weeks or so the news was filled with stories\n","about the allegedly slow movement of the British fleet while\n","negotiations went on.  That, my friends, was only a cover story. \n","The Royal Navy was actually joining up and moving as rapidly as\n","possible toward South Georgia Island.  If the task force arrived\n","in time to save the secret base, a major battle was likely.  The\n","official stories about \"slow movement\" of the British armada were\n","intended to give a cushion of time for that battle.  If need be,\n","the fleet would have several days to retake South Georgia Island,\n","then it could move on to arrive near the Falklands on the\n","announced schedule.  In this way the crucial importance of South\n","Georgia Island would be hidden and the big secret preserved.\n","\n","   It was initially expected that advance elements of the British\n","fleet would reach the vicinity of South Georgia Island within two\n","weeks.  That would have been soon enough to attack the joint\n","Rockefeller-Russian commando team and stop the drilling before it\n","was completed.  But Russian Cosmospheres and submarines made a\n","shambles of the plan.\n","\n","   Key advance elements of the South Georgia attack contingent\n","left Ascension Island early April 14, two days before it was\n","announced officially.  Shortly after they did so, they ran into\n","trouble.  Russian Cosmospheres and attack submarines closed in on\n","a single ship which was critical to the planned counterassault on\n","South Georgia Island.  The Cosmospheres bombarded the bridge and\n","combat information center of the ship with neutron radiation.  In\n","moments the ship was without any command, its communications and\n","radar silenced.  Then a Russian \"sub\" closed in and quickly\n","finished off this key British ship with torpedoes.  It broke\n","apart with secondary explosions and sank rapidly.  So far as is\n","known, there were no survivors.\n","\n","   This unexpected shock in the mid-Atlantic produced two\n","results, both important:\n","\n","First, it caused a slowdown in the race toward the South Atlantic\n","by the British armada.  The task force had to be regrouped into a\n","configuration better suited for an enroute defense, but that cost\n","valuable time.  Public announcements from London about the\n","progress of the fleet reflected this slowdown.  The timetable for\n","arrival on battle stations near the Falklands started stretching\n","out longer and longer.  All this bought extra time for the joint\n","commando team on South Georgia Island.  The drilling continued.\n","\n","The other result of the sinking was equally important.  Word was\n","flashed to the South Pacific Stealth navy to prepare for possible\n","action.  It was obvious that the Russian Navy was getting\n","involved in the Atlantic, which meant that the Royal Navy could\n","be in big trouble.  During the dead of night, early April 15, the\n","seven Stealth ships put to sea from their twin secret bases in\n","southern New Zealand.  They deployed to a secret operational\n","headquarters area in the Antipodes Islands, 450 miles southeast\n","of New Zealand.  Their electromagnetic shields were operating to\n","provide protection from attack.  These shields make it impossible\n","to communicate with the outside world or even to see it, as I\n","explained last month; but once they arrived at the Antipodes, the\n","Stealth ships hooked up to buoys equipped with shielded\n","communication cables to the Island headquarters.  The Antipodes\n","headquarters, in turn, was in constant touch with the South\n","Georgia base by way of a transoceanic cable around the tip of\n","South America.  The deployment of the available ships of the\n","South Pacific Stealth fleet was exactly what the joint\n","Rockefeller-Russian planners had hoped for.  The ships had been\n","flushed out from their essentially invulnerable hiding place in\n","New Zealand!\n","\n","   The British ship's sinking of April 14 was also followed by\n","other events.  On April 15 the Argentine Navy started moving out\n","of port.  The same day, Alexander Haig arrived again in Buenos\n","Aires.  Supposedly he was there as a diplomat, but in reality he\n","was there as a General, dealing with Generals.  Haig is the top\n","Governmental operative of the Rockefeller cartel, as I have\n","revealed in the past.  He was making sure that the Argentines did\n","not get cold feet and back down at that critical moment.  Four\n","days later, April 19, Haig left for Washington.  As he boarded\n","his plane, Haig somberly told reporters, \"Time is running out.\" \n","And so it was, my friends, for the secret South Georgia base.\n","\n","   The very next day, April 20, the drill broke through into the\n","hollowed-out cavern of the naval base.  Bolshevik military\n","analysts in London had not expected that it could be completed\n","until at least the following weekend.  The British fleet was\n","still out of range.\n","\n","   The weapon which the commando team inserted down through the\n","long hole was a small, compact Russian neutron bomb.  When it was\n","detonated inside the confines of the huge artificial cave, the\n","effects were devastating.  The intense radiation instantly killed\n","everyone inside the base.  Also the heat and blast effects of the\n","bomb are believed to have damaged all the ships inside\n","sufficiently to badly disable them.\n","\n","   Meanwhile, Russian Cosmospheres and submarines were converging\n","on the Stealth ships which were near the Antipodes Islands\n","awaiting orders.  From a distance, the ships were invisible to\n","the eye due to their protective shields, which also protect\n","against beam-weapon attack; but they were sitting ducks for the\n","tactics which the Russians employed.\n","\n","   Floating overhead, the Cosmospheres located the seven ships\n","using their Psychoenergetic Range-Finding equipment known as PRF. \n","As I have reported in the past, there is no method known by which\n","PRF can be jammed.  The Cosmospheres radioed the exact locations\n","of the ships to the attack submarines.  The \"subs\" were armed\n","with special non-homing, non-nuclear torpedoes designed to\n","explode on impact.  More sophisticated torpedoes would have been\n","thrown off course or detonated prematurely by the protective\n","shield of each ship; but these simple torpedoes just cruise right\n","through each invisibility field to strike the ship and explode. \n","Within 15 minutes after the attack began, all seven Bolshevik\n","Stealth ships were on their way to the bottom, and with them went\n","their Bolshevik Commanders and mercenary crews collected from\n","around the world.\n","\n","   The South Pacific action took place just after sunset local\n","time.  The time here in Washington was around 2:00 P.M. April 23. \n","That evening Secretary of State Haig was seen briefly in public\n","with the new British Foreign Minister, Francis Pym.  Pym was\n","wearing the artificial pseudo-smile which diplomats are taught\n","always to display in public.  But not Haig.  Haig was grinning\n","from ear to ear, and no wonder.  The joint Rockefeller-Russian\n","military operation had been a brilliant success.  The secret\n","Bolshevik South Atlantic fleet had been virtually wiped out,\n","bottled up inside South Georgia Island; and the South Pacific\n","fleet, while not totally wiped out, had been badly crippled.  By\n","working together, the Rockefeller cartel and the Russians had won\n","the secret naval war of the Southern Hemisphere.\n","\n","Topic #3--As I say these words, news reports give the impression\n","that war is about to erupt in the South Atlantic, but the real\n","war in the Southern Hemisphere is already over.  What we are\n","watching now is the beginning of its bloody aftermath.  That\n","aftermath is the battle for the Falkland Islands.  They have been\n","promised to Argentina as a reward for her role in the secret war.\n","\n","   At this moment the Bolsheviks here in Washington are pressing\n","for a public announcement that the United States will side with\n","Britain.  As soon as that takes place, military action will heat\n","up fast around the Falklands.  Britain has no choice but to\n","fight.  She has already suffered casualties which cannot be\n","explained without a public battle; but by fighting, the\n","Bolsheviks in Britain are running the risk of a humiliating and\n","tragic defeat for the Royal Navy.\n","\n","   Meanwhile, the Rockefeller strategists here are now\n","concentrating on a fast-building, anti-nuclear-war campaign.  On\n","all sides now we are hearing about the so-called \"nuclear freeze\n","movement.\"  There are documentaries, articles, publicity of all\n","kinds to sensitize us to the terrors of nuclear war.  In recent\n","months, there have even been referenda popping up on election\n","ballots dealing with the nuclear war issue.  Medical doctors are\n","banding together to warn the public about what would happen if\n","there were a nuclear war.\n","\n","   We are being told that all this is just popping up\n","spontaneously.  We are now 37 years into the nuclear age and\n","nothing like this has ever gained so much momentum before, yet\n","now we are supposed to believe that millions of Americans have\n","spontaneously gotten the same ideas at the same time.  If you\n","believe that, my friends, I give up.  Movements like this never,\n","and I mean never, develop without leadership, organization, and\n","money--and plenty of it.\n","\n","   What we are watching is the Rockefeller public relations\n","machine at work.  As I've explained in the past, the Rockefeller\n","cartel cannot afford to let a nuclear war take place.  If it\n","does, they will lose everything because they are not in a\n","position to control it.  Instead, the deadly enemies of the\n","Rockefeller cartel, the Bolsheviks here, will win out if there is\n","a war; and so the Rockefeller faction is now doing everything in\n","its power to prevent a nuclear war.\n","\n","   The present anti-nuclear-war orientation of the Rockefeller\n","cartel creates certain temporary common interests between them\n","and Russia; but as Russia's new rulers know very well, this does\n","not spring from any great moral perspective on the part of the\n","Rockefeller group.  It's purely a matter of practical necessity\n","right now for the Rockefellers.\n","\n","   The Russians regard the United States as a house divided, and\n","they are exploiting that division by working in careful ways with\n","the Rockefellers.  Their first priority is to rid the world of\n","the deadly Bolshevik menace of all-out, even suicidal, nuclear\n","war; but once that is done, they know that there will be a day of\n","reckoning with the Rockefeller cartel some day.\n","\n","   The Rockefeller group is working toward a definite objective\n","with their new anti-nuclear-war propaganda.  That objective is\n","renewed power--and power that moves them closer to their old\n","dream of WORLD GOVERNMENT.  The Bolsheviks here have unwittingly\n","provided fertile ground for the powerful new Rockefeller antiwar\n","campaign.  Under Bolshevik control, the so-called Reagan\n","Administration has become so hawkish that it's scaring people. \n","The Rockefeller antiwar campaign is designed to capitalize on\n","that latent fear as a tool of power.\n","\n","   These days the smell of war is in the air.  The Falklands\n","crisis is helping to make that more intense.  The Rockefeller\n","propaganda machine is now paving the way for the argument that\n","surrender of sovereignty is the only way to avoid war.  A new\n","super-United Nations of sorts is now in the works to fill the\n","bill.  It will have teeth!  As presently envisioned, the new\n","organization will be based in Geneva, Switzerland.  The working\n","name, though this may be changed, is the \"World Nonproliferation\n","Council.\"  The plan is to bring it into being as the outgrowth of\n","nuclear nonproliferation treaties, but its true purpose will be\n","to use fear--the fear of war--to control us all.\n","\n","                       LAST MINUTE SUMMARY\n","\n","   Now it's time for my Last Minute Summary.

Many of the announced\n","\tWindows NT applications are ports of existing Windows 3.1 apps, and\n","\tNT also runs existing 3.1 applications.\n","\n","\tThus, it appears logical that Windows NT should share the following\n","\tgroups with the other members of the Windows family:\n","\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.apps\n","\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.tools\n","\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.misc\n","\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.programmer.win32\n","\t\n","\tThe following groups are also clearly applicable to Windows NT as\n","\twell as Windows 3.1:\n","\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.announce\n","\t\tcomp.os.ms-windows.advocacy\n","\t\n","\tIn conclusion, the only clear argument for the separation of the\n","\tWindows 3.1 and Windows NT hierarchies is different internal\n","\tstructures of Windows 3.1 and Windows NT.  And yet operating\n","\tsystems such as OS/2, Macintosh OS, Xenix and Coherent all have\n","\tundergone major rewrites without having been split into separate\n","\tnewsgroup hierarchies.\n","\n","\tFurther, Windows 3.1 is due for a major rewrite itself in 1994 --\n","\twhen the fully 32-bit, protected-mode and with-DOS-built-in next-\n","\tgeneration Windows, \"Chicago\", debuts next year, surely it should\n","\tremain in the same hierarchy.  And what, then, would be the jus-\n","\ttification for separating Windows NT from other Windows versions?\n","\n","\n","DISCUSSION PERIOD:\n","\tThe discussion period will run from 27 April, 1992 to 18 May, 1993.  \n","\n","VOTING:\n","\tThe CFV (Call for Votes) will be issued around 19 May, 1993, based on\n","\tthe feedback received during the discussion period.

The\n","white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\n","Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\n","pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\n","can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\n","properties of the Station change during assembly.\n","\n","The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\n","it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong\n","part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\n","limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\n","docking system.\n","\n","The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\n","launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\n","(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never\n","had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\n","(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\n","de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\n","residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\n","impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\n","Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\n","the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\n","further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\n","it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\n","nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\n","\n","The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\n","Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\n","for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\n","which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a\n","controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we\n","did with Skylab).\n","\n","The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\n","used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\n","on humans.
